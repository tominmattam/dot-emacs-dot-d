# dot-emacs-dot-d

This is my Emacs Configuration File. Initially I wrote everything on an emacs init file. I did not write everything you see here from scratch, I adapted this one from [harry's](https://harryrschwartz.com/ "harry swartz") and [aaron's](https://aaronbieber.com/ "aaron's")  configuration files. 

This is the second iteration of my configuration file in  **org- mode**. 

Why ?

Because [harry swartz](https://harryrschwartz.com/ "harry swartz") convinced me that org-mode is ***bonkers***. 
Apparently it is. :tw-1f60e:
